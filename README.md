# RushHour
Rush Hour is a sliding block puzzle, where the goal of the game is to get the red car out of a six-by-six grid full of automobiles by moving the other vehicles out of its way. However, the cars and trucks (set up before play according to a puzzle card) obstruct the path which makes the puzzle harder.

- Run rushhour.py.
- Type test(nvehicles, board_size) where nvehicles is the number of vehicles on the board, and board size is a tuple (x, y) - x is the width and y is the length.
